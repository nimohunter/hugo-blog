      <description>Project in github
 This projects base on Real Time pose estimation of a textured object and here is Code
if you cannot run this offical code, maybe you can use this, My base Real time estimate prject, which just modify a little to make the offical code can build and run successful. (maybe the offical code is old and cannot run&amp;hellip;)
Request:
 Opencv3 with opencv_contrib(this extra-package include aruco) Qt Creator   As the name - &amp;ldquo;Real time pose estimation with aruco&amp;rdquo;, I use the Opecv3 method SovlvePnp to Solve this problem, you can see the final result at TODO</description>

      <description>The camera, which last use, imaging effect is not very good. So bought a new one, Which support 720p video with 30FPS and more, use this opportunity, talk about use chArucoBoard to calibrate the camera.
References:
 Calibration with ArUco and ChArUco
 1. Generate ChArucoBoard From the reference, can get Source code from here
Because with Qt, the Qt Pro file is:
QT += core QT -= gui CONFIG += c++11 TARGET = new_camera_Calibration CONFIG += console CONFIG -= app_bundle INCLUDEPATH += .</description>

      <description>Before Begin SolvePnP , Finds an object pose from 3D-2D point correspondences., which is the method that rebuild 3D position from 2D picture.
We DO NOT Care about the how to use SolvePnP, we try to understand the inner meaning of SolvePnP, and the 5 methods.

      <title>Install OpenCv3 in Debain</title>

      <description>About Opencv, this is a wonderful CV library. But for some reason, the installation isn&amp;rsquo;t kindful for begenner.I try to use Visual Studio, but lots of Opencv DLL files makes me crazy. So I choose Debian platform, and Qt, which i feel more comfortable.
1. Prepare We should install some dependencies.
Ubuntu/Debian: ubuntu sudo apt-get install qt5-default apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev apt-get install pkg-config references: first-example-code-error
CentOS yum install cmake gcc gcc-c++ gtk+-devel gimp-devel gimp-devel-tools gimp-help-browser \ zlib-devel libtiff-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel gstreamer-devel \ libavc1394-devel libraw1394-devel libdc1394-devel \ jasper-devel jasper-utils swig python libtool nasm if you don not install these dependecies, maybe you will see this error:</description>
